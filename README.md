What is Roblox?
Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004
and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history,it was relatively small, both as a platform
and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic

I create projects. Of Roblox of course.
